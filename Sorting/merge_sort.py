'''
Steps:
1. Divide the array into two halves
2. Recursively sort the two halves
3. Merge the two halves

Time Complexity:
    Best Case: O(n log n)
    Average Case: O(n log n)
    Worst Case: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Stability: Stable
In-place: No

Merge Sort is suitable for large datasets as its average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n log n), where n is the number of items.
