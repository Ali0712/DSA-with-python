## Recursion in DSA

This file serves as a reference for understanding recursion in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It covers core concepts, recursive trees, callbacks, and examples.

**What is Recursion?**

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself one or more times. This self-similarity allows for elegant solutions to problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.

**Key Concepts**

* **Base Case:** A condition that halts the recursion and provides a direct solution to the simplest form of the problem. Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely.
* **Recursive Case:** The portion of the function that breaks down the problem into a smaller subproblem and makes a recursive call to solve it. This process continues until the base case is reached.

**Recursive Tree**

A recursive tree is a visual representation of the function calls during recursion. It illustrates the hierarchical relationships between function calls:

- Each node represents a function call.
- Children of a node represent the recursive calls it makes.
- Depth of the tree indicates the number of recursive calls before reaching the base case.

**Example: Factorial Function**

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. Here's a recursive implementation with a comment explaining the base and recursive cases:

``` function factorial(n) {
// Base case: 0! = 1
if (n === 0) {
return 1;
}

// Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


// Recursive tree for factorial(4):
//        4
//       / \
//      3   * (factorial(3))
//     / \
//    2   * (factorial(2))
//   / \
//  1   * (factorial(1)) (base case)
```

**Call Stacks**

During recursion, function calls are pushed onto a call stack, which keeps track of the current state of each call. Each recursive call creates a new activation record on the stack. When a function returns, its activation record is popped off.

**Callbacks**

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions. The receiving function can then invoke the callback at a later time. Recursion can be used with callbacks for complex control flows.

**Example: File System Traversal**

A function might take a file path and a callback. The main function recursively traverses directories, calling the callback for each file encountered. The callback can perform operations on each file.

**Benefits of Recursion**

* **Elegance:** Concise and readable solutions for self-similar problems.
* **Modularization:** Focused on solving a specific subproblem, improving code maintainability.

**Drawbacks of Recursion**

* **Stack Overflow:** If the base case is not reached correctly, infinite recursion can lead to a stack overflow error.
* **Efficiency:** Iterative solutions (using loops) can be more efficient for large datasets.

**When to Use Recursion**

Consider using recursion when:

- The problem can be naturally broken down into self-similar subproblems.
- A recursive solution leads to more readable and maintainable code.

For potentially more efficient solutions, explore using loops to achieve the same outcome.
